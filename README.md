# receivers
This repository is dedicated to storing code and ancillary data used for creating receivers (vector point layer) at different heights of a 3D building facade (implementing the CNOSSOS horizontal placement method of receivers) for noise simulations. The method is described in [Kefalopoulos et al. (2012)](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC72550).

The repository includes the following:

- ipynb-file: notebook with Python code implementing the aforementioned method
